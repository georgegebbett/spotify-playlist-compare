# Spotify Wrapped Comparer

When my Spotify Wrapped came out this year I was consumed with one question - in a year where everything had been so strange, had I actually found any time to listen to new music?

The obvious solution to this question was to build a fun little web app to find out. The Spotify Wrapped Comparer was thrown together in an afternoon, and basically just trawls through the playlists on your Spotify looking for ones with 'Your Top Songs' in the names. When it finds these it lets you choose two to be compared to each other, and then performs said comparison, whilst judging your taste in music all along. 

It is deployed in a Heroku app and theoretically anyone can try it out, except that for some reason Spotify keep telling me it doesn't work and they will not open it up to the general public which is a shame. I'm not too bothered about this because they're a real pain to deal with and I don't care enough about it to really fight them, so if you want to try it out, let me know and I will add you to the testers list!

That is basically it!
